# Gradient Descent

The gradient descent method is used to fit a theoretical model to laboratory data for radiative decay counts. This is achieved by minimising a function that calculates the reduced Chi squared. 

Two subplots are produced:

- A 2D graphical representation of the value of reduced Chi squared over the 2D parameter space with the Gradient Descent trajectory over-drawn.

- A plot of the reduced Chi-squared value vs the time fo the result of the Gradient Descent solver


The Gradient Descent solver has an initial estimate of initial number of atoms, N0 = 11960, with mean lifetime, tau = 230 seconds.
